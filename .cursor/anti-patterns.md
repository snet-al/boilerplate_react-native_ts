AVOID THE FOLLOWING AT ALL TIMES:

- window, document, navigator
- HTML, CSS, or DOM APIs
- Web-only libraries
- Inline styles inside JSX
- Business logic inside screens
- Multiple axios instances
- Unnecessary platform conditionals
- Side effects inside render
- Anonymous functions passed to heavy components
